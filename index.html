    <p>
        The service we will be testing is a fitness app that follows a freemium model. This means the application is
        free to use, but has premium features that are locked behind a paywall. This application has three core software
        features:
    </p>
    <p class="abList">1. A list of videos that can be filtered by labels (e.g., length, body part, and whether the video
        is available to all users or premium-only).
    </p>
    <p class="abList">2. The ability for users to upgrade and downgrade their accounts.
    </p>
    <p class="abList">3. Performance charts that have limited data visibility, depending on whether the user has a free
        or premium account.
    </p>
    <p>
        This document will cover testing strategies for functional, performance, and internal design characteristics of
        the high-level design presented. More specifically, this document will look at:
    </p>

    <p class="abList"> &#x2022; The integration of the product's video filtering function and video filter user
        interface
    </p>
    <p class="abList"> &#x2022; The functionality of the product's account management features
    </p>
    <p class="abList"> &#x2022; The functionality differences between 'free' and 'premium' accounts performance tracking
    </p>
    <p class="abList"> &#x2022; Validation testing to ensure functional and non-functional requirements are met
    </p>

    <h2 style="justify-content: center; display: flex">Test Plan</h2>
    <p>
        This testing strategy will follow both a top-down and bottom-up integration testing approach where the testing
        will be conducted in 3 separate phases. The decision to use these approaches was made since the tests will be
        based on a high-level design. The high-level design of the system highlights the system's overall structure and
        main modules, and user workflows. A top-down approach allows for testing of the main modules and user-visible
        features early on. At the same time, the bottom-up testing approach ensures that the main modules are thoroughly
        validated. By combining both of these testing approaches, we are able to analyze both the high and low-level
        aspects of the system for optimal coverage.
    </p>

    <p>
        The system has a modular architecture that has three main modules: Video List Filter Module, Account
        Upgrade/Downgrade Management Module, and Performance Chart View Module. The decision to break the integration
        testing into three phases was made since it aligns with the system's architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
        Phase 1 will consist of testing the Video List Filter Module. It will test the video list filter functionality
        and integration with a user interface. This phase is necessary as it isolates content discovery and filtering
        functionality, which is foundational to the user experience. Phase 2 will test the Account Upgrade/Downgrade
        Management Module, which is the account tier management functionality. This phase is necessary as the account
        upgrade/downgrade process is central to the user experience, as it enables premium-level features. The final
        phase will test the Performance Chart View Module, which is the fitness metrics visualization. This module is
        dependent on the proper functioning of the account management system, which is why it is the last phase.

    <h2 style="justify-content: center; display: flex">Phase 1: Video Filtering and User Interface Integration
        Testing</h2>
    <p>
        In phase one, our team is focusing on validating the filtering functionality within the fitness app, ensuring
        that users can seamlessly apply, remove, and clear filters based on different criteria such as video labels,
        genres, and account types. These tests are designed to confirm that the app accurately filters content based on
        user preferences and subscription tier, ensuring that free-tier and Pro-tier users receive the appropriate
        content. Additionally, we are examining the app's navigation flow, ensuring that users can easily log in,
        navigate through the app, and interact with the video filtering system without issues. The table below outlines
        the specific test cases designed to validate the app's filtering capabilities, UI responsiveness, and navigation
        functionalities, ensuring a smooth user experience.

    <h2 style="justify-content: center; display: flex">Phase 2: Account Management Functionality Testing</h2>
    <p>
        In this testing phase, our team is validating the functionality of account tier transitions within the fitness
        app, focusing on the user interface elements that manage the visibility of upgrade and downgrade buttons. These
        tests ensure that users can easily upgrade or downgrade their accounts between free-tier and pro-tier states,
        and that the UI reflects these changes in real-time. By simulating upgrades, downgrades, and invalid states, we
        aim to confirm that the app correctly manages account state transitions and displays the appropriate buttons to
        users. Additionally, we are testing the execution of commands triggered by these buttons, ensuring that the
        underlying logic is functioning as expected. The following table outlines the specific test cases designed to
        verify the proper handling of account state changes, button visibility, and the related user interface behavior.

    <p>
        For phase three of testing, our team is focusing on the integration of key functionalities in the fitness app to
        ensure that all features are working seamlessly for both free-tier and Pro-tier users. This testing validates
        the user experience by ensuring that the app’s performance chart and subscription management features function

        according to their subscription status. The following key areas from the app's feature set will be tested:
        restricted access to chart sections based on subscription tier, visibility of recent activity and detailed
        metrics, proper functioning of the FullView and LimitedView components, and accurate notification and handling
        of subscription changes. The table below outlines the specific test cases for these requirements.
